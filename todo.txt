TODO
====
- think about failure/edge conditions
	- site asks for resupply, but fulfillment cannot fulfill that request b/c of manufacturing problems
	- in this case, available quantity 3 and under will continue to raise the threshold events until there is more than 3 available qantity at the saga
		- this is not waht the site wants, they want 5 more kits... not 15
	- couple ideas:
		- keep track of the last date ShipmentAcknowledged was received (the last time the site was resupplied)
		- when publishing threshold triggered, keep track of that date
		- when evenuating the rule, see if there are any ShipmentAcknowledged that have been handled AFTER the last threshold has been triggered
		- if that condition is met, it means the site has not been resupplied (b/c no ShipmentAcknowledged has arrived since last resupply trigger), so do NOT ask for more kits!
